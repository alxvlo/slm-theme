1️⃣ Outcome-Driven Pricing Language
This shifts the conversation away from cost and toward business impact.


Core Philosophy Statement
Use this wherever pricing appears (website/packages/deck):

Pricing Built Around Business Outcomes — Not Just Deliverables

At Showcase Listings Media, pricing isn’t based solely on the media you receive — it’s
structured around the value it creates for your business.

Our memberships and services are designed to help agents:

   ●​   Win more listings
   ●​   Strengthen brand perception
   ●​   Save time through streamlined workflows
   ●​   Maintain consistent market visibility
   ●​   Scale marketing as their business grows

We view marketing as an investment in competitive advantage — not a transactional expense.

That’s why we offer flexible structures including:

✔ Listing Memberships for efficiency and cost control​
✔ Social Memberships for long-term brand growth​
✔ À-la-carte services for customization​
✔ Strategic guidance included — not upsold

Because the goal isn’t just content delivery — it’s business momentum.




Short Version (for rate sheet)
Our pricing reflects outcomes — not just output.

We structure services to help agents compete stronger, market smarter, and operate more
efficiently. Every package is designed to deliver measurable business advantage, not just media
files.
Reframe Language for Objections
Use these on calls:

If they say “That’s expensive”

      Totally fair — most agents compare media on price alone.​
      Our clients typically evaluate it based on how it helps them win listings, strengthen
      perception, and save time. That’s where they see the return.

If they compare competitors

      Many providers sell media.​
      We structure marketing systems that agents use to grow their business — that’s the
      difference they’re investing in.
