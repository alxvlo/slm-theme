## What's In Progress
- 🟡 Square integration for recurring membership billing
- 🟡 Guest vs logged-in pricing visibility on services page
- 🟡 Mobile responsiveness audit

## What's Left to Build
- ⬜ Square recurring billing integration and testing
- ⬜ Guest/logged-in conditional pricing display
- ⬜ Create "Zillow Showcase" page in WP Admin with new template
- ⬜ Full end-to-end user journey testing (all 3 user types)
- ⬜ SEO optimization (meta tags, Open Graph, structured data)
- ⬜ Performance optimization (image compression, lazy loading audit)
- ⬜ DNS / SSL / domain setup (if not done)
- ⬜ Launch readiness checklist and go-live

## Known Issues
- Pricing is currently hidden for ALL users ("Contact us for current rates") — needs to be visible for logged-in users only
- "Zillow Showcase" WP page needs to be created in admin and assigned the template
