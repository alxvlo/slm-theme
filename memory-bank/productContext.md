# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Real estate agents need professional marketing to win listings, justify higher commissions, and build brand authority. Most media companies operate as generic vendors — Showcase positions itself as a strategic partner invested in agent success. The website must communicate this differentiation and provide a seamless ordering and management experience.

## Problems It Solves
- Agents lack professional marketing assets for listing presentations
- Agents waste time coordinating with multiple vendors
- Agents struggle with camera confidence and content consistency
- No scalable, predictable marketing system as agents grow
- Agents are treated as "just another client" by commodity media providers
- Agents need a central place to manage orders, subscriptions, and deliverables

## How It Should Work

### User Types
There are three user types with distinct access levels:

1. **Guest (not logged in)** — Can browse the site, view available services and packages, but **cannot see prices** and **cannot place an order**. Must create an account first.
2. **Logged-in User** — Can see prices, place orders through **Aryeo** (WP plugin), and join recurring memberships through **Square**. Has access to the Client Portal (dashboard, order tracking, subscription management, profile).
3. **Admin** — Full WP Admin access. Manages customer listings, orders, testimonials, portfolio items, and site settings. Has access to the Admin Portal (order management, revenue stats, customer metrics, notifications, configuration).

### Guest Visitor Journey
1. Agent visits the website (via referral, search, or social)
2. Views services, packages, and membership tiers (prices hidden)
3. Creates an account via the front-end registration form
