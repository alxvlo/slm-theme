# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
Real estate agents need professional marketing to win listings, justify higher commissions, and build brand authority. Most media companies operate as generic vendors — Showcase positions itself as a strategic partner invested in agent success. The website must communicate this differentiation and provide a seamless ordering and management experience.

## Problems It Solves
- Agents lack professional marketing assets for listing presentations
- Agents waste time coordinating with multiple vendors
- Agents struggle with camera confidence and content consistency
- No scalable, predictable marketing system as agents grow
- Agents are treated as "just another client" by commodity media providers
- Agents need a central place to manage orders, subscriptions, and deliverables

## How It Should Work

### Public Visitor Journey
1. Agent visits the website (via referral, search, or social)
2. Views services, packages, and membership tiers
3. Creates an account via the front-end registration form
4. Books a package or joins a membership
5. Completes payment through Aryeo (orders) or Stripe (subscriptions)
6. Schedules shoots and receives deliverables

### Client Portal Journey
- Sign in → Dashboard with order counts and recent orders
- Place new orders (redirects to Aryeo order form)
- View/track existing orders with status indicators
- Manage subscription (upgrade, billing portal via Stripe)
- Update profile information

### Admin Portal Journey
- Sign in → Dashboard with revenue stats, order counts, customer metrics
- View all orders with search, filter, and pagination
- Drill into individual orders for full details
- Manage subscriptions and view customer subscriptions
- Configure Aryeo, Stripe, notification settings
- Receive webhook notifications for new orders

## User Experience Goals
- **Premium feel** — the site itself should feel like a competitive advantage
- **Modern & sleek** — blue and gold visual style reflecting high-end real estate marketing
- **Trust-building** — social proof, portfolio, and outcomes-driven messaging
- **Fast & confident** — minimal friction from landing to booking
- **Mobile-friendly** — agents browse on the go
- **Self-service** — clients can manage their own orders and subscriptions

## Competitive Landscape
- No direct named competitors identified
- Differentiation: "Growth Infrastructure Partner" vs. commodity media providers
- Key messaging: "Showcase doesn't sell media. We deliver competitive advantage."
- Unique strengths: camera confidence workshops, strategic partnership, membership-based growth frameworks
