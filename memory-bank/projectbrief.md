# Project Brief

## Project Name
Showcase Listings Media (SLM)

## Overview
A premium WordPress website and client platform for Showcase Listings Media — a real estate marketing company that provides professional media services (photography, video, drone, virtual tours, etc.) to real estate agents. The site positions the company as a *Growth Infrastructure Partner*, not just a media vendor. Includes a full client portal, admin portal, Aryeo integration (via WP plugin) for ordering/scheduling, and Square for recurring membership billing.

## Core Requirements
- Public marketing pages (Homepage, Services, Portfolio, About, Contact, Blog)
- Service/package showcase with listing packages, social packages, memberships, and add-ons
- Subscription membership system (Square integration) with multiple tiers
- Client portal with order tracking, subscription management, and profile
- Admin portal with order management, customer overview, revenue stats, and notifications
- Booking & payment integration via Aryeo
- Portfolio gallery with lightbox and carousel
- Custom login/registration system (front-end themed)
- Admin-editable text content on About and Contact pages
- Testimonials system (custom post type)
- Blog with archive and single post templates
- Legal pages (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service)

## Goals
- **Primary:** Convert real estate agents into clients by communicating competitive advantage, professionalism, and partnership
- **Secondary:** Provide a seamless client experience from account creation through order delivery
- **Secondary:** Establish "Growth Infrastructure Partner" positioning in the market

## Scope Boundaries
- Marketing website + client/admin portals — NOT a standalone CRM
- Order payment handled via Aryeo (WP plugin); recurring membership billing via Square
- No native mobile app

## Target Users
- **Guest (not logged in):** Can browse services but cannot see prices or place orders
- **Logged-in User:** Can see prices, place orders through Aryeo, and join memberships via Square
- **Admin:** Full WP Admin access — manages customer listings, orders, testimonials, portfolio, and site settings

## Timeline
No fixed deadline — active development.
