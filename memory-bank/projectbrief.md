# Project Brief

## Project Name
Showcase Listings Media

## Overview
A premium website for Showcase Listings Media — a real estate marketing company that provides professional media services (photography, video, etc.) to real estate agents. The site positions the company as a *Growth Infrastructure Partner*, not just a media vendor.

## Core Requirements
- Service/package showcase pages
- Membership plans with tiered pricing
- Booking & payment integration via Aryeo
- Shoot scheduling workflow
- Portfolio/gallery to display past work
- Outcomes-driven messaging throughout the site

## Goals
- **Primary:** Convert visiting real estate agents into booked clients by communicating competitive advantage, professionalism, and partnership
- **Secondary:** Build brand authority and online visibility for Showcase Listings Media
- **Secondary:** Establish the "Growth Infrastructure Partner" positioning in the market

## Scope Boundaries
- This is a marketing & booking website — NOT a CRM, internal dashboard, or mobile app
- Payment processing is handled externally via Aryeo
- No agent portal or login system required at this stage

## Target Users
Real estate agents looking to:
- Win more listings through elevated marketing
- Build a stronger personal brand
- Save time with streamlined marketing systems
- Scale their marketing as their business grows

## Timeline
No fixed deadline — brand new project starting from scratch.
